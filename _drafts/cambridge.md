Conversation over a bottle of claret from the year I was born at the CH
founder's feast. talking with a (very drunk) scholar of Wittgenstein, who wants
to convince me that the account of formal semantics in the Tractatus is the
correct one. I manage to extract from him the room in which LW lived while in my
house (not mine).

Violin recital at Peterhouse. A small room---close enough to hear the soloist
gasping for breath between passages. The moment of terrible vulnerability when
she reaches up to turn the page.

Easter concert in King's. Quatuor pour la fin de temps, by an unknown ensemble
from Hertfordshire. Stunning. Clarinet soloist harmonizing with her own echoes
off the vaulted ceiling. During the fifth movement I see lights moving through
the screen to the forechapel. Long silence before the final applause begins. We
stay on for an unexpected Maundy Thursday Meditations service---a setting of the
Lamentations by White. The windows are dark, the ceiling above the altar is
barely visible. I saw candles earlier---broad wax columns streaming fire into
the empty air. It's freezing.

Good Friday. Cold spring sun on the backs, bells half-muffled at Bene't's.
Melon-colored evening light on the chapels.

Frigid boat-race spectation at Furnivall gardens. Bottle of wine, cheese, little
Cambridge-blue flags. Houseboats rising with the tide & obstructing our view.
Unfamiliar Oxford scarves. We lose.
