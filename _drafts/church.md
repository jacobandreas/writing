Hobbies I picked up in the last term included ringing church bells and singing
orchestrated masses (with rehearsals in a chapel). I attended Christmas formal
at Trinity, visited a Queens' chapel service and went caroling with the
Peterhouse choir. Were it not for the exculpatory effects of occasional Shabbat
dinners, I would, in short, be justified in declaring myself a _de facto_ member
of the Church of England. (My atheism and total non-attendance of services go
firmly in the "good Anglican" column here.)
