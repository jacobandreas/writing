## Craniofacial development of hagfishes and the evolution of vertebrates

Cyclostomes: jawless vertebrates; vertebrate basal lineage
Believed to constitute a single clade
Hagfish believed to be most primitive
But:
  Hard to compare anatomy betw. hagfishes and lampreys
This paper shows that hagfish-specific traits (arguments against their primitivity) are explained by secondary changes to the lineage.

All vertebrates in 2 groups: with and without jaws.
(Most have jaws.)
Hagfish, previously in "jawless", now thought to be ancestor of both groups.
Principally b/c head is a different shape: hagfish nose connects to main body cavity, but not lamprey
Also, not known whether hagfish adenohypophysis (ant. pituitary) comes from endoderm or ectoderm (as lamprey)
Recent evidence suggests endoderm

Experiment froze embryos and inspected them
Result: all from ectoderm!

Consequence: hagfish not most ancestral
