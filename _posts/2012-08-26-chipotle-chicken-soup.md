This began as an attempt to make posole, but due to a lack of all the necessary
ingredients (what kind of Los Angeles grocery store doesn't carry hominy?) is
now something else entirely.

***

## Ingredients

- 1 lb. boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1 in. pieces
- &frac12; of a yellow onion, diced
- 3 cloves
- A few pinches of powdered cumin
- 1 bay leaf
- 4 ears of corn, stripped from cob
- Chipotles en adobo
- 4 cups chicken stock
- 1 tbsp. neutral oil

## Preparation

1. Cook chicken in oil until brown on the outside
2. Add onion and cook until soft
3. Add corn and cook for 2-3 minutes
4. Add bay leaf, cumin, cloves and chipotles[^1] (including some of the sauce
   they're packed in) to taste
5. Add chicken stock
6. Simmer, partially covered, for another 10-15 minutes

Serve with pickled jalape&ntilde;os and queso cotija.

[^1]: All chiles deliver their heat in different ways. Chipotles strike only
after a delay, leaving a delicious (and, if I may be forgiven for saying so,
faintly sexual) moment of anticipation between potency and pain.
