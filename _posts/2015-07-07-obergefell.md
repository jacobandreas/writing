1. One has to make a distinction between _marriage_ as an arbitrary member of
   the class of all possible civil relations, and _marriage_ as a contingent
   historical phenomenon. If I were designing a government from scratch, it's
   not at all obvious that I would want to give any kind of marriage (straight
   or inclusive) special status. 

2. Nevertheless it is certainly the case that in our current circumstances, the
   exclusion of queer people from the institution of marriage deprives them of
   something fundamental. (Social, "spiritual"; not just legal.)

3. This is precisely why Kennedy's opinion reads like a piece of poetry. How do
   you convince a jurist that exclusion from this particular (and, I insist,
   arbitrary) legal relationship amounts to a deprivation of life and liberty?

4. Roberts:

   >  Although the majority randomly inserts the adjective “two” in various
   >  places, it offers no reason at all why the two-person element of the core
   >  definition of marriage may be preserved while the man-woman element may
   >  not. [...] It is striking how much of the majority’s reasoning would apply
   >  with equal force to the claim of a fundamental right to plural marriage.

   Quite right!

5. There's a weird tension between arguments (from both sides)
   that marriage somehow exists for the welfare of children, and the
   obvious fact that marriage is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition
   for having a child. Why can't we just recognize that we're talking about two
   different things here---if it's really important for children to have
   multiple parents, why not just create a special status for households
   that include children and multiple parents? Why not let that special status
   be assigned at the birth the first child?

6. Scalia:

   > But what really astounds is the hubris reflected in today’s judicial
   > Putsch. The five Justices who compose today’s majority are entirely
   > comfortable concluding that every State violated the Constitution for all
   > of the 135 years between the Fourteenth Amendment’s ratification and
   > Massachusetts’ permitting of same-sex marriages in 2003.

   Hubris? Scalia is surprised by the possibility that all the states might have
   been wrong; on the contrary, it seems outrageous to expect that the states
   could get everything right the first time around. Constructing an internally
   consistent set of beliefs or preferences is _really hard_: individual people
   can't do it, so how could a legislature?

7. As dramatically as the structure of society has changed in the last few
   centuries, the basic humanist program of "life, liberty, happiness" has held
   up astonishingly well. Viewed from the right angle, all social "progress"
   since the establishment of the republic has simply been a refinement of our
   understanding of what this program really demands. Even now, our beliefs and
   laws are surely inconsistent with a fully considered humanism, but they grow
   more consistent over time.

8. We do not expect the judiciary to achieve immediate enlightenment (a "fully
   considered humanism"), but we expect them to be ahead of the curve, and to
   carry the rest of us along with them.
