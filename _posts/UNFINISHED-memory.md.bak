What, specifically, is lost at the moment of death? Certainly not conciousness,
transient brain state---or more precisely: Brain state is destroyed not only
when we die, but in fact constantly. Twain writes "I do not fear death. I had
been dead for billions and billions of years before I was born, and had not
suffered the slightest inconvenience from it;" better yet, that "I" (the
experiencer of qualia) has died---been irretrievably obliterated---thousands of
times in the last minute without noticing. So we should be concerned with the
cessation of concious experience.

It seems the only self worth worrying about is fully described in structure of
the brain (or perhaps in even more general symbols), without regard to its
dynamic state.  What becomes inaccessible only after the heart stops? Memories,
prejudices, opinions, reflexes, half-recollected scraps of poetry and unfinished
plans: information at a higher level of abstraction. Clinical death destroys
that self simply because memory becomes a locked box when it ceases to move the
hands and lips. 

This will not always be the case. Even at present, small pieces of the
self-as-aggregation-of-abstractions can be documented and stored---incompletely,
imperfectly---eventually reconstituted on the substrate of another three-pound
mass of fatty brain tissue (just as the aggregation of abstractions I identify
as myself includes as substructure borrowings from Auden and my kindergarten
teacher).  Human beings are far less interesting than we think if Ray Kurzweil
can reconstruct an emotionally-satisfying father from genes and old photo
albums; nevertheless it doesn't strike me as outrageous to suggest that any
being so reconstructed deserves to be called _part_ of Kurzweil's father. 

At some level it's just a question of where we're comfortable drawing the line
that separates the self from the rest of the world. Let holism be damned---then
the kind of immortality conferred by creating paper records of memory, even of
trips to the grocery store [^1], is not poetic but real in the most literal
sense possible.
