## The Baroque Cycle (Quicksilver, The Confusion, The System of the World)

## The Fountainhead

A bad book, but (if I may be permitted to make a Nietzschean distinction) not an
evil one.

## Stranger in a Strange Land

## The Moon is a Harsh Mistress

Heinlein of all people should know better than to write a heist novel where
everything goes according to plan.

## Istanbul

## Ethics of Authenticity

## The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks

## The Dog Stars

## Lolita

One of the most devastating sentences I have ever read: "[...] and the dust was
running and writhing over the exact slab of stone where Charlotte, when they
lifted the laprobe for me, had been revealed, curled up, her eyes intact, their
black lashes still wet, matted, like yours, Lolita."

## Anathem

As science fiction about clocks, polyphony, and the allegory of the cave:
entertaining. As fiction about cultures which have been isolated from society
for centuries, and the geopolitical implications of alien invasion:
unsatisfying.
