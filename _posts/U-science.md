"A scientific theory's predictive power is not the only basis on which to judge
its correctness. It's a special case of ability to predict held-out data, which
is itself a special case of a general 'variety of predictions' criterion."

Uncontroversial, but future predictions are not just another way to judge the
quality of a scientific theory: they are the *best* way. (As humans, we cannot
simply disregard known data in formulating new theories; as Bayesians, we don't
want to.)

But bigger point: what is the purpose of science?

Certainly, at least one of the functions is to make predictions (in the hope
that newly-predicted entities are of instrumental benefit to humans). In this
respect the past predictive power of theories is, empirically, the best
predictor of their future predictive power. (This is not a tautology!)

I think (though this is more controversial) that it is also the function of
science to make ontological statements about the nature of the world. If
curve-fitting requires moving to a fundamentally incompatible model every time
we improve our predictive accuracy, then we have no reason to believe that our
current model makes any correct claims about the nature of reality.
"This is the case. We've discarded all of Newton."
No we haven't! Newton's (taking Newton as representative) more important claim
is that nature is governed by physical laws which are the same for all
observers. The fact that he neglected to include the speed of light in the list
of laws is a *tiny* ontological claim compared to the rest of his theory.

To the extent that I can believe anything about the universe to be True based on
evidence, I certainly believe the bulk of what Newton says about the way it
works.
