## Snow Crash
I'd been meaning to get to this one for a while. It left me a little confused
about all the Stephenson hype---it's clever, but after a while the whole "I'M
PARODYING GENRE CONVENTIONS" business gets tiresome. The best science fiction
offers a vision of the future that's at least plausible; the world in Snow Crash
feels too much like a slapstick routine to be believed.

## The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet
This got one of the most enthusiastic reviews I've ever seen in the New Yorker.
The book feels like an intricate piece of clockwork---it's clear from the
beginning that it's been meticulously researched (the lengthy note on
calendaring conventions certainly helps) carefully put together, and beautifully
written. Indeed, the only problem is the story itself, with a villain taken
straight out of a Disney movie and a crime so gruesome it nearly derails the
whole operation.

## The Gone-Away World
Another entertaining if more or less mindless read. A young-adult novel written
for adults, a post-apocalyptic-war-buddies-ninja-road-story with a full helping
of bright lights and loud noises and a clever plot twist.

## The Diamond Age
After this one I understood the enthusiasm about Stephenson. This is the novel I
was expecting _Snow Crash_ to be---occasionally outrageous but basically
plausible (and surprisingly well-written for a science fiction novel). The
_Diamond Age_'s Neo-Victorians and Drummers are far more interesting than _Snow
Crash_'s pizza franchises, and its technology an integral part of the story
rather than a fancy toy. The bowler-hat kitsch gets to be a bit much some times.

## Cloud Atlas
I find it funny that Mitchell cites Calvino as an inspiration---this is the book
that _If On A Winter's Night A Traveller_ should have been. The characters are
well-realized (especially given their brief time on the page), the structural
device (unlike Calvino's) restrained, and the subject matter---an extended
meditation on predation and force---refreshingly novel.

## 36 Arguments for the Existence of God
Left no lasting impression. Atheists are wonderful! Ivy League universities are
wonderful! Sometimes orthodox Jews are OK too!

## The Lord of the Rings
I had never actually read these books myself---my father read them to me when I
was very young, and I remembered the plot but nothing about the writing. The
writing, as I was warned before I picked them up, is occasionally stirring but
often very dull indeed. Tolkien's epic style reads like the best translations of
Beowulf when it works, and like the worst translations of the Bible when it
doesn't. Nonetheless, the story is morally compelling in a way fantasy novels
rarely are (Auden has a great essay about this) and a fantastic yarn by any
account.

## Super Sad True Love Story
My roommate, at whose recommendation I picked this up, put it best---this would
have been a great piece of short fiction, but there's not enough in it for a
book. Shteyngart's alarming vision of the future hits its mark, but the
eponymous love story is unconvincing.

## Swann's Way
Too many words. I'm woefully underqualified to comment on Proust's masterpiece,
but my impression after a first reading was of a work filled with breathtakingly
evocative figurative language obscured by unparseable sentences and excess
verbiage (I'm told this is as true of the French as it is of the translations).
I'm glad I read it, but the experience was definitely more work than play.

## Notes from the Underground
_Crime and Punishment_ (the only other Dostoevsky I've read) is more
psychologically interesting, but it's a testament to the power of his writing
that I had to take frequent breaks from _Notes_ to recover from the physical
discomfort induced by reading.

## A Game of Thrones
I needed something cheap and filling after the last two books; _Game of Thrones_
fit the bill nicely. The critics hailing Martin as the "American Tolkien" are
far too generous to the American, but like Tolkien at his weakest Martin tells a
great story dreadfully (I have the sentence "Her flesh had grown as thin and
ragged as Lannister hopes" bookmarked in case I ever decide to put together one
of those lists of horrible similes written by fifth graders). I complain, but I
bought the second book for a rainy day as soon as I finished the first, so there
must be something in it.
