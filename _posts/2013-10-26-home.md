I forgot how much I love this place---ripe red fruit, cars that stop for
crosswalks, cool fog on summer mornings, and fall evenings rolling warm and
thick as honey from the hills down to the Bay. These first weeks back have been
about the rediscovery of old pleasures: walks down College in the lingering
Indian summer; hikes in the mountains, up past the hills, bleak and sculptural
under their vellum skin, forest air dusty with dry pine and incense cedar. And
new ones: the groan and musk of Berkeley brown-shingles, frenzied brunches at
the Thai temple Mongkolratanaram, and noontime carillon concerts.

But I find that I've grown attached to seasons, miss the changing of leaves (our
handful of firetruck sweetgums a poor substitute for the extravagant hardwood
forests of the East) and the smell of new snow. It will be a poor winter without
scarves and padded jackets, with birds singing straight through December and the
redwoods green all year round.

I can't complain---my knuckles no longer blister with cold, and there are fresh
vegetables whenever I want them. I needed continuous sunlight for the first
seventeen years of my life; I may grow to need it again.
