Committing this to the Internet in case I lose the index card it's written on.

Some background: my last day at Microsoft, I went with coworkers to a
nondescript-looking Taiwanese restaurant in Bellevue with a line out the door.
Among the dishes we ordered was a heavily-spiced pork stew served over rice.
Several months later, I developed a sudden craving for the dish; a Google search
turned up about 20 recipes, most of which disagreed wildly with each other. I
chose one at random, followed it, and then immediately threw away the result: it
called for half a cup of soy sauce for a pound of ground pork, and was so salty
as to be basically inedible.

The craving, for better or worse, didn't go away. After a little tinkering I've
put together a consensus recipe that may not be entirely authentic (I'm
certainly no judge of authenticity), but quite tasty regardless.

## Ingredients

- 3 shallots, finely diced
- 4 shitake mushrooms, roughly diced
- 2 lb. pork belly (not ground pork), chopped
- 4 pieces star anise

- &frac34;&Prime; ginger, minced

- Scallion or cilantro, chopped

## Preparation

1. Marinate pork in a few tablespoons of soy sauce.
2. Brown pork over high heat, then reserve, leaving rendered fat in pan.
3. Fry shallots in pork fat, then reserve, still leaving a little fat in pan.
4. Stir-fry mushrooms.
5. Add pork, shallots, garlic and ginger, cook together for a minute or two.
6. Add anise, cinnamon, cloves, soy sauce and water to cover partially.
7. Bring to a boil, and then reduce to very low heat.
8. Cook for 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally.
9. Serve over white rice, garnished w/ scallion or cilantro.
