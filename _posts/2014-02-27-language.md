1. All meaning is use.

   1. Put another way: there is nothing real between syntax and pragmatics.
      Attempts to axiomatize the in-between place independent of what comes
      above and below will probably be incomplete or unsound.

   1. Which is not to say there aren't useful abstractions at this level, or
      models with latent variables that correspond to "semantics" in the
      classical sense---only that a map from strings to database queries has
      not yet reached "meaning".

   1. Which, in turn, is not to say that the problem is with the database
      itself. Certainly we need some level of abstraction above individual pixel
      intensities--this is what perception does for us. But in telling me that
      some subset of all utterances correspond to logical forms, you haven't
      yet explained how I will interpret any utterance in this subset, nor
      explained what to do with all the utterances outside of it.

   1. Many standard "problems" in the philosophy of language ("the morning star
      is the evening star", etc.) arise only because we insist on ascribing
      sentences with meanings independent of their speakers' and hearers' belief
      states.

   1. I regard the early chapters of _Philosophical Investigations_ as basically
      persuasive on this view.

   1. Or, from a different angle, a colorful anecdote: One of my old professors
      is at a 
      dinner party with Elizabeth Anscombe, who says "Look---I will prove to you
      that a speaker-independent sentence meaning cannot be built up
      compositionally from its parts." As they are leaving the party, she goes
      to the host, shakes his hand, and says "Fuck you very much for dinner."
      The host replies "You're very welcome." 

   1. She means to express thanks, she chooses a set of words which in other
      contexts would convey exactly the opposite, but her thanks are received
      and correctly interpreted. This is only possible if G.E.M.A. has a _very_
      precise model of how the speaker will respond to any set of sounds she
      produces---and this is all she needs! No reason to worry about how to say
      "fuck you" in the fluent calculus. Can we formalize this?

1. Q: If logical propositions are not enough, what abstraction do we
   use for the representation of meaning? A: A decision process.

   1. More specifically: think of the world you live in as approximated by a
      POMDP. Language forms both a class of observations (when produced by
      others) and a class of actions (when produced by you).

   1. Qua observation in a POMDP, all speech tends to alter the listener's belief
      state.

   1. With the exception of performatives, the only first-order effect language
      can have on the world is to alter belief states.
   
   1. Of course, nobody would ever communicate if it didn't have second-order
      effects: altering others' behavior by altering their belief states.

   1. Language cannot be understood without a model of the speaker's belief
      state and policy. Language cannot be produced without a model of the
      listener's belief state and value function.
