The river acquires a new name at the Anchor, shedding "Granta" and becoming
"Cam" as it flows past the punt hires and under the Silver Street Bridge.
Upstream and southwest, it traces a lazy route towards the shady apple orchards
of Grantchester. It's a popular walking path---Bertrand Russell followed it
religiously, Wittgenstein made the voyage by canoe, and even today one
inevitably crosses paths with a familiar fellow or Nobel Laureate, shoes caked
with mud, on the way to a cup of tea or a pint at the Green Man.

Immediately above the bridge, even on frosty days, the river carries a steady
traffic of punts. Blanket-swaddled Chinese families listen in shivering silence
as punt chauffers lie exuberantly about Cambridge's buildings and bridges.

Downstream the river makes a gentle right, drifting past the multicolored
boathouses of Cambridge---Goldie and Caius in antiseptic green, Jesus with its
precarious clock tower, Clare Hall tacked like a doghouse to Clare's side, the
hideous aluminum shed called Combined---before continuing on toward its distant
terminus at King's Lynn.

In months of rowing we have seen the Cam in all her moods: when, bloated with
rainwater, she tugs at the rolling boathouse doors; when, on windy days, small
waves on her surface break backwards and show her flowing in the wrong
direction; when, at dawn's first breaking, she wreaths herself in a delicate
pink haze.
