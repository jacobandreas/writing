76 Storey's Way, now "Hostel V" in official college records, was once (more
vividly) known as "Storey's End". In those days it belonged to Ludwig
Wittgenstein's doctor; Wittgenstein himself lived here during the final three
months of his life, and is buried in a cemetary just around the corner.

So far I've been disappointed in my hopes of having a copy of the _Tractatus_
flung at me by an irritated poltergeist. The author probably couldn't find his
way through the house these days---the previous occupants' imposing stone facade
and dense shrubbery remain, but the interior walls have been shuffled: parlors
and servants' quarters made into bedrooms, kitchens re-floored in linoleum,
bathrooms subdivided into smaller bathrooms to house hastily-installed showers.
The garden, too, has been repurposed, to house a teaching greenhouse, an art
studio and a mysterious wooden shed whose sole purpose seems to be the storage
of cheap liquor.

For a fraction of what I once paid for a windowless partition in a decrepit
Bushwick loft, I have the largest bedroom I've ever occupied, with three
closets, a bricked-up fireplace, and a view onto our quiet, leafy street. Each
morning, a member of college staff arrives to clean the kitchen and bathrooms,
take out the trash, and leave pleading, laminated requests for cleanliness[^1].
(This cheerful woman is known in Cambridge parlance as a "bedder"; if I lived in
proper college housing she would actually straighten the inside of my room as
well!).

The confusingly-named Hostels---stately Victorian homes wedged between the
Churchill and Trinity Hall playing fields---are the main graduate accommodation
provided by the college. Next door is the Fitzwilliam Master's Lodge, and then
more Churchill housing. Near the end of the campus are family flats and a
cluster of more modern single-occupancy apartments which are known as the
"Pepperpots" but resemble no receptacle I have ever seen used for storing
spices. The street terminates in a bright red mailbox bearing the royal cypher
of George VI.

Churchill College itself is a great deal less picturesque---the archetype of
certain regrettable architectural fashions of the 1960s. Unfinished brick and
concrete planes project awkwardly from the corners of every building; wooden
window casings stubbornly refuse to line up with each other or lie flush in the
faces of the walls that contain them; vaguely menacing cubist beast-sculptures
rise up at intervals from obsessively-tended lawns. The only feature I really
enjoy is the airy, wood-paneled dining hall, where I (surprisingly often) find
myself lingering in conversation over a plate of rudely boiled root vegetables
or a glass of wine.

Things are quieter here than in the center of town. Ugly Churchill attracts few
tourists, and neighboring Fitz and Murray Edwards even fewer, so the only
traffic comes from scientists and students <span class="foreign">en route</span>
to the math department or laboratories at the West Cambridge Site. These two
locations also conveniently house all of my lectures and research meetings, and
without occasional obligations at Queens' and Sunday trips to the farmers'
market it would be very easy to forget about the existence of the medieval City
altogether.

please put your dishes away when they are dry as there is very little counter
space in the kitchen."
